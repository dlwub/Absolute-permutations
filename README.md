# Coding challenge - Absolute permutaions
We define P to be a permutation of the first  natural numbers in the range [1, n]. Let pos[i] denote the value at position i in permutation P using 1-based indexing.

P is considered to be an absolute permutation if |pos(i) - i|  holds true for every i in [1, n].

Given n and k, print the lexicographically smallest absolute permutation . If no absolute permutation exists, print -1.
Note: The solution is not optimal and can be improved.
